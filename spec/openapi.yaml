    ZelFlux is completely open source and we encourage everyone to feel free and contribute :)
    # Introduction
    ZelFlux posseses with 4 tier hiearchy level API. 
    * Public API level - available without any permission, does not require signing
    * User API level - user level permission, requires signing
    * ZelTeam API level - ZelTeam level permission (an appointed Zel Team member has access to those API calls), requires signing
    * Admin API level - Admin level permission, requires signing. ZelNode owner.
